The 'core' directory contains the html and files from the dashboard template.
A few of these have been modified. The 'built_html' folder is all the html built
with the build_website.m file.

Contents of both of these directories go into the same folder on web2:

 rsync -avr core/  web2:/var/www/vhosts2/hfradar.msi.ucsb.edu/public_html/comparisons_beta/

and:

rsync -avr built_html/  web2:/var/www/vhosts2/hfradar.msi.ucsb.edu/public_html/comparisons_beta/
